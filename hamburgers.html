    <h2>Greasy Boy</h2>
    <p>It's no question that burgers are a delicious food that will definitely clog your arteries. But life is short, so who cares? They come with all sorts of toppings and can can be whatever you want them to be. They're very versatile, and they are easy to cook for a large group of people. It's a greasy boy for sure, but it's worth every bite. Anyways, lets make it - shall we?</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Ground beef - can also be pre-made beef patties if you would like, that's what I'm going to use</li>
        <li>SEASONING - use at LEAST the 4 essentials and then hrow on whatever else you want</li>
        <li>Hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Cheese - whatever kind of sliced cheese you want, but for the love of God don't use American, it's literally just PLASTIC</li>
        <li>Veggies - I'm going to use mushrooms and onions but use whatever sounds good to your tastebuds</li>
        <li>Condiments - again, whatever sounds good to you, I'm going to use mayo</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season and then cook your ground beef patties. You can do this on a grill or a cast iron or honestly any pan you have at home</li>
        <li>Toast your buns! I usually do this in the same pan I cooked my beef in to give it some FLAVOR. Also, don't forget butter on the buns</li>
        <li>Add your condiments on your buns (lets be real, it needs to be on both sides or the sandwich isn't going to be wet enough)</li>
        <li>Add your meat and cheese to the bottom bun</li>
        <li>Add your toppings - I pre-cooked my mushrooms and onions because that makes them tastier</li>
        <li>add the top bun!!</li>
        <li>Enjoy clogging your arteries</li>
    </ol>
