    <h2>The Godfather of All Foods</h2>
    <p>Ah yes, pizza...the holy grail of grease and cheese and as many toppings as you can fit onto it. The favorite food of children, and a food adults would love to eat more of if it didn't put them at risk of a  heart attack. Pizza has got to be one of the most universal foods on the planet, with many loving all the variations to it. Let's begin this main quest, The Quest of The Gods</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough - just buy some from the frozen pizza section, who cares lol</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce - depending on what kind of pizza you're making, this could be marinara or like...alfredo</li>
        <li>Cheese - I would use mozzarella for this personally</li>
        <li>Topppings - I'm just using pepperoni but use whatever you'd like. Just don't use too many or it'll effect the way your crust cooks</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Get your pizza crust out and onto a pan, if you have a pizza stone - great, use that. I personally never pre-heat mine so I'm just going to put my crust straight onto it</li>
        <li>Add your sauce - don't get too close to the crust, leave about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of space</li>
        <li>Add the cheese - don't be scared of it, but also don't drown it</li>
        <li>Add the toppings, again - just don't drown it</li>
        <li>You forgot to preheat the oven again? Me too, set it to like, 375, and then wait forever if your oven sucks like mine</li>
        <li>Put it in the oven for like, 123-15 minutes, or until your crust is nice and golden and crispy</li>
        <li>Burn your mouth eating it, and use potholders for Pete's sake.</li>
    </ol>
