    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Weird Pasta Casserole</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a weird dish made of flat noodles and weird feeling cheese (Ricotta). The only good part about lasagna is the sauce, and hopefully they also used beschamel because otherwise it'll just be a sad dish. With that being said, a lot of people really enjoy lasagna, but they are lying to themselves. Pasta in a casserole dish has got to be the weirdest concept to date, and it looks like a slop of mystery food like you would get in a school cafeteria. Without further hesitation, lets dive right in to this depreesion era looking food! (Meaning you have to be depressed to eat it.)</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-cooked lasagna noodles (or maybe uncooked...I can't remember how its made)</li>
            <li>Meat of choice (probably hamburger if you're poor like me, but italian sausage would be good too)</li>
            <li>Pasta sauce, the red kind</li>
            <li>Beschamel, and no I'm not going to teach you how to make it</li>
            <li>Ricotta (the abomination of cheeses)</li>
            <li>Probably some kind of shredded cheese like mozzarella</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Figure out if you need the noodles cooked or uncooked because I'm not Googling it for you</li>
            <li>Start by greasing a casserole dish so it don't stick</li>
            <li>Put down a layer of noodles, followed by a layer of sauce</li>
            <li>Add a layer of either mozzarella or ricotta or both, whatever you want to do. If you have beschamel, now would be the time to use it</li>
            <li>Repeat the previous steps over and over until you fill the pan, top the casserole off with shredded cheese</li>
            <li>Shit, you forgot to preheat the oven. Set it to 400 and wait an ungodly amount of time</li>
            <li>Put it in the oven for like....20? 30? No idea, until it looks done</li>
            <li>Make sure you use potholders to pull it out and blow on it before eating, you lil idiot</li>
        </ol>
